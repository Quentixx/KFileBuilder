# KFileBuilder
A simple desktop application to build directories and files from templates. Built with [Compose for Desktop](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) using Kotlin.

⚠️ Note: This project is currently in the planning stage and specific features are still being defined.

## Planned features
- #### Template creation: 
    Users will be able to create custom templates for folders and files by specifying the names, locations and contents of each item.
- #### Template saving:
    Created templates can be saved for future use, saving time when creating recurring folder and file structures.
- #### Template customization:
    Users can modify and customize existing templates by adding, removing, or modifying elements.
- #### Folder and file structure creation:
   Utilizing saved templates, users can quickly create predefined folder and file structures by specifying the destination location.
- #### Intuitive User Interface:
   The user interface will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, enabling users to easily manage their templates and create folder and file structures with just a few clicks.

## In progress
- __Basic Interface__ : user-friendly interface using [Compose for Desktop](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform)
- __Templates tab__ : interface for creating and managing templates

## TODO
- Set up the template managing logic (creating, editing & deleting).
- Implement the creation of folder and file structures from templates.
